# landing_page_learningProject
A learning by doing landing page project for "The Odin Project" course.

## What is the aim of this project?
This is a project proposed in "The Odin Project (T.O.P.)" course: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page

For this project I‚Äôll be creating an entire web page from a design T.O.P has provide to me. 
The design they‚Äôre providing comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors I have/should to use.
- Website design: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png
- Fonts & colors: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/02.png

## Some extra notes about this project
- In the last few lessons of the course I have learned quite a lot about the use of flexbox, so this project will serve as a self-assessment to find out if I have been able to assimilate all the concepts well and apply them correctly.
- It is not completely necessary to have absolute pixel equivalences with the proposed design, since the important thing here is to apply well the arrangement of the elements.
- It is possible that, once I have reached the right web design (the one that looks like the proposal), the project will be given a more personal touch (at least, in terms of images, texts and other content, etc), but always sticking to the proposed design.
